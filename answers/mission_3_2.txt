Subject: Fixing Missing Wire Transfer Problem

I hope you're doing well!!
Greetings, Dr. Horrible

We appreciate you bringing this to our notice. We've found a technical issue in our system that caused the wire transfer for Startup X to not show up in your account after conducting a comprehensive investigation.

Unfortunately, during the transaction history cleanup procedure, the $10,000 wire transfer was unintentionally filtered away even though it was actually received. We really regret any inconvenience that this has brought about.

We've fixed the problem and added the wire transfer back to your account; it should now show up in your transaction history. In addition, we have taken steps to enhance the accuracy of our transaction records and stop such instances from happening again.

Best regards,
Customer Support Backend Team
